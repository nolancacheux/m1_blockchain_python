    "In Python, there is a data structure that acts a bit like a list but refuses duplicates: this is the `set()`. When you add an object `object` to a set `dummySet` using `dummySet.add(object)`, Python first checks if this object already exists in `dummySet`, and if so, adds nothing. Similarly, you can remove an object with `dummySet.remove(object)` and check if an object is present with `if object in dummySet: ...`. **Be aware though, sets are not indexed like lists, which means you cannot get the i-th element using** `dummySet[i]`**.**\n",

When you want to add, remove, or verify the presence of an object in the set, it compares the hash of the object with the hashes of the objects present in the set. This is convenient because our certificates already have a `hash()` function and an `equals(otherCertificate)` function.

Node 2 forges block index 11: it then transmits it to 1, 3, and 4. Nodes 1 and 3 accept it, while 4 cannot accept it because it is waiting for block index 1. Realizing its delay, it broadcasts a request to all nodes asking for blocks 1 to 10, and it sets aside block 11. Nodes 1, 2, and 3 hear its request and send blocks 1 to 10. Node 4 receives them, integrates them into its blockchain, and can thus add block 11 to them.</font>\n",

Thus, enhance your `receive_object_from_node` function to take into account integers.\n",
