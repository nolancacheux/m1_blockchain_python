    "In this practical work, we will implement the details of both Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and as a bonus Proof-of-Work (PoW). Since PoS is becoming the most popular consensus algorithm, and suits any decentralized system well, it is the most interesting to look after.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may seem counter-intuitive since until now we haven't seen nor coded a decentralized system (this is for TD 4). We will stick to one central blockchain on which multiple public keys operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "So one would argue : why doing it now since once we port the model to a decentralized network, blockchain instances will be out of synchronization. Well the answer, as we've seen in the lecture, is **deterministicity**. The consensus is **universal** and does not need people to communicate. Like a law of nature, somehow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take as an example the pi constant ```ùúã ‚âà 3.14159...```. Since we've all been taught the same mathematics in class, we all learnt the same operators ```+```, ```-```, ```√∑``` ..., the traditional digits 0..9, and all the rest, which are all really just a human construct, we are all able to calculate ```ùúã``` (we actually did in TD 1). We can thus say there is a universal consensus on ```ùúã```. You do not need to talk with a libanese student to agree on the value of ```ùúã```.\n",
    "\n",
    "For blockchains, the same applies. Every node in the network owns the same software that runs the blockchain (like us, the same mathematics) and can thus **calculate the same forger for next block**. This way, a consensus is reached without exchanging information."
