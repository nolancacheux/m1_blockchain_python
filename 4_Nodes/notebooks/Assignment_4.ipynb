    "The last major part of your blockchain in Python boils down to the **management of communication between the different actors in the network** of this blockchain. Now that you have defined all the rules governing the stability and security of your blockchain on your local machine, you still need to manage the sending and receiving of information with others on the network, who will probably try to cheat you with blocks that turn the system to their advantage.\n",

    "Remember the concepts discussed in class: a **node** is an entity operating on the communication network and interacting with other nodes. For our blockchain, a node ensures the management of the blockchain locally and shares it on the network, while providing easy access to any user who connects to it. Its tasks include:\n",

    "As we discussed in the course on consensus algorithms, certificates are only added to a block at the time of forging that block. Until then, they need to be stored somewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common practice for each node to keep a \"certificate box\" in which it places the certificates given to it (whether they come from a human or another node) and only empties it when forging a block.\n",

    "Remember: **certificates are always unique in the blockchain!!** Two certificates that have the same hash are strictly identical (same issuer, same creation date, and same data). Normally, issuing the same certificate twice in a blockchain is prohibited, and if this happens, it is probably a duplicate and therefore should be discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there is a data structure that acts a bit like a list but refuses duplicates: this is the `set()`. When you add an object `object` to a set `dummySet` using `dummySet.add(object)`, Python first checks if this object already exists in `dummySet`, and if so, adds nothing. Similarly, you can remove an object with `dummySet.remove(object)` and check if an object is present with `if object in dummySet: ...`. **Be aware though, sets are not indexed like lists, which means you cannot get the i-th element using** `dummySet[i]`**.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, you can be sure that all your objects in `dummySet` are present in only **one single copy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A set works with hashes to check the presence or absence of a Python object in itself. When you want to add, remove, or verify the presence of an object in the set, it compares the hash of the object with the hashes of the objects present in the set. This is convenient because our certificates already have a `hash()` function and an `equals(otherCertificate)` function. We just need to make Python understand that it should use these functions for the set.\n",

    "\n",
    "For hashing any object, Python has a generic function `hash(object)` that takes an object as input and returns an **integer**. In reality, `hash(object)` is strictly equivalent to `object.__hash__()`, and therefore every Python object has a `__hash__()` function.\n",

    "In our simulation, our three nodes are created simultaneously at the birth of the blockchain. Thus, when a block is forged, it is sent simultaneously to the three nodes and we never have indexing problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in reality, it doesn't work that smoothly. Some nodes may join the blockchain well after the first block has been forged. So, this new node, which only has the genesis block (index 0), will reject all the blocks relayed to it because all the other nodes are already on block index 10, or 100, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do things properly, the following process should be included in our `BlockchainNode` class:\n",
    "* When receiving a block, if its index is higher than the index of our last block + 1, it may mean we are behind compared to all other nodes in the network. In this case, we set this block aside until we have the missing blocks.\n",
    "* After setting a block aside, we send a request to everyone to receive the missing blocks by index.\n",
    "* If we receive a request for missing blocks, we send back to the requester the blocks we have among those requested.\n",
    "* Whenever we forge/receive a block, we check if one of the blocks set aside can be added following it. If so, we repeat this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"77aa77\">***Example:*** Nodes 1, 2, and 3 all have the same blockchain composed of 10 blocks. A new node joins the network: node 4. It only has the genesis block, index 0. Node 2 forges block index 11: it then transmits it to 1, 3, and 4. Nodes 1 and 3 accept it, while 4 cannot accept it because it is waiting for block index 1. Realizing its delay, it broadcasts a request to all nodes asking for blocks 1 to 10, and it sets aside block 11. Nodes 1, 2, and 3 hear its request and send blocks 1 to 10. Node 4 receives them, integrates them into its blockchain, and can thus add block 11 to them.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this result, you will necessarily need to send and receive an additional type of object via your portal: the block request. To keep your implementation as simple as possible, make requests for one block at a time: you can thus reduce the request to a single integer representing the index of the block to be requested. Thus, enhance your `receive_object_from_node` function to take into account integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend creating a new class to manage the set-aside blocks. However, don't worry about sending too many requests and overloading the network with information, as long as your code works, I will be happy.\n",
