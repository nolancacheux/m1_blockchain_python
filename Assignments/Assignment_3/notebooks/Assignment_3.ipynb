    "In this practical work, we will implement the details of both Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and as a bonus Proof-of-Work (PoW). Since PoS is becoming the most popular consensus algorithm, and suits any decentralized system well, it is the most interesting to look after.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may seem counter-intuitive since until now we haven't seen nor coded a decentralized system (this is for Assignment 4). We will stick to one central blockchain on which multiple public keys operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "So one would argue : why doing it now since once we port the model to a decentralized network, blockchain instances will be out of synchronization. Well the answer, as we've seen in the lecture, is **deterministicity**. The consensus is **universal** and does not need people to communicate. Like a law of nature, somehow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take as an example the pi constant ```ùúã ‚âà 3.14159...```. Since we've all been taught the same mathematics in class, we all learnt the same operators ```+```, ```-```, ```√∑``` ..., the traditional digits 0..9, and all the rest, which are all really just a human construct, we are all able to calculate ```ùúã``` (we actually did in Assignment 1). We can thus say there is a universal consensus on ```ùúã```. You do not need to talk with a libanese student to agree on the value of ```ùúã```.\n",
    "\n",
    "For blockchains, the same applies. Every node in the network owns the same software that runs the blockchain (like us, the same mathematics) and can thus **calculate the same forger for next block**. This way, a consensus is reached without exchanging information."

The primary of these decisions is the selection of the next forger, but each blockchain project can include additional decisions, such as the project's direction, reward choices, and more...\n",
