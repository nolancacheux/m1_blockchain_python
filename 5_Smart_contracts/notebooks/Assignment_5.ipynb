    "### Smart contracts\n",
    "\n",
    "With what we've covered in the course, you are now capable of implementing smart contracts in your blockchain. Here's a reminder:\n",
    "* Smart contracts are created by embedding a piece of code in a certificate, which is then added to the blockchain.\n",
    "* To modify one or more values of the contract, you must create a new certificate that will engrave our contract modification action into the blockchain.\n",
    "* Reading the values of a contract takes into account all the modification certificates present in the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement these three functionalities. For this, it is important to distinguish two types of certificates: contract definition certificates, and contract writing certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For contract definition, we need a way to store the source code of the contract but also to do something with it. In the Ethereum blockchain, for example, smart contracts are stored in their compiled form (with 0s and 1s). In our situation, we are lucky to benefit from the many practical aspects of Python's \"interpreted language\" characteristic: its ability to be executed *on the fly*.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For your knowledge: there are two types of programming languages: the \"compiled\" type, where your code is converted into 0s and 1s before execution (for example, when you create a .exe file, the code has already been compiled) and the \"interpreted\" type, where compilation occurs at the time of execution, and where the reading of the code is done \"in reading order\". Python is of the \"interpreted\" type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we will code our contracts in Python. **A Smart Contract will thus be represented by a string describing a Python class named `SmartContract`.** Here are the set of rules we will follow when coding a smart contract:\n",
    "* The contract's constructor always takes the creator's public key as a parameter.\n",
    "* Any contract function intended to modify the state of the contract (by changing one or more of its values) must have the public key of the person calling this function as the first argument.\n",
    "* Other functions are read functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"7777aa\">In a new file `smart_contract.py`, still in your `scripts` folder, create the class `SmartContractDefinition`. Since it's a certificate, this class must inherit from `Certificate`, and you need to replace the `build_payload()` function to incorporate its `sourceCode` field.\n",
    "\n",
    "`sourceCode` is a string that contains the source code of the Smart Contract.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "> To illustrate our smart contract implementation, we will be building a minimal chat application. In the next cell, you can observe how such a decentralized application can be built."

    "\n",
    "With what you've just implemented, you've understood: smart contracts are nothing more than a computer program embedded in the blockchain, with which people interact via writing certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are talking about more than just Smart Contracts here; we are talking about **decentralized applications (DApps)** because this system allows for the automatic management of principles and rules on a completely decentralized network while remaining secure through the mechanisms of the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude this last tutorial and the course on Blockchain and Applications, I propose you use your new tool to code a small decentralized application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Form a group of 4 people with others of your choice. Once your group is formed, come see me (during the course, on Teams, or by email) presenting the composition of your group. I will then give you a decentralized application topic that you must create using everything we have coded during the module, including this assignment. Your topic will include the following elements:\n",
    "* The objective of the application, in the broadest sense of the term\n",
    "* A more detailed description of all the functionalities that your DApp must present\n",
    "* A set of aids on the realization of this application\n",
    "\n",
    "**It is mandatory to implement the DApp using the blockchain system we implemented throughout the module.** You can, however, modify it any way you want to meet the requirements for the DApp (add new certificate types, change the smart contract system, etc...).\n",
    "\n",
    "With your code, you are required to **write a notebook** that showcases a demonstration of your DApp through a mini-scenario. Simulate users interacting with your application and show how things go.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the day of the last course (February 28th), you will have to orally present your notebook as well as your code and the choices you made in the design of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "I remind you that this mini-project counts for 20% of the final grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever the project you receive, you will need to write your contract in a `.py` file as if you were going to use it conventionally, unlike in this notebook where the mini-chat is written in a cell. Do not panic, this changes nothing since you store the source code in the blockchain in the form of a string. You will simply need to load the `.py` file as if it were a text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, here is a function that returns, as a string, the entire content of a **file located in the same folder as this notebook**."
